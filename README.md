Hypurr Tilted download repo

This is the download repo for updates to the Hypurr Tilt Chrome extension, prior to it being published on the Chrome Web Store.

Notes

App release 1.0 for Chrome is here

How to install:

Download and extract zip to a local folder (https://github.com/tiltmenot/download/blob/main/tilted.zip)
Click build.zip on the left, then on the page that opens click the Download Raw icon top right
Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions in address bar
Enable developer mode (top right)
Click the Load Unpacked button (top right)
Extension will install
Go to https://app.hypurr.fun/launches
Click the little Extensions button top right
Pin the Hypurr Tilt extension, then click it
You don't need any TILT to use the tool.

The app is using the hypurr.fun backend, if that backend gets overloaded, then the app will be impacted (same way the website and TG both get impacted).

This is a Chrome extension, and may work on other browsers, but is only supported on CHROME
